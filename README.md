# Spam-Prediction-System
## Detecting spam and phishing emails using machine learning models

The goal of the project is to develop a comprehensive machine learning methodology and to deploy a client application supported by a PostgreSQL database. The outcomes of this project will not only enhance our knowledge of effective spam and phishing detection techniques but also offer a practical solution with real-world significance in both research and industry contexts.
